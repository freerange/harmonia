At Free Range everyone is responsible for everything, but who is responsible for delegating work so everything gets done?

CHAOS.


Notes
-----

You'll need to set the SMTP_PASSWORD environment variable; one of of doing this is via the `env` recipes that `recap` provides.

After first deployment, you'll need to create a `config/free_agent.yml` file containing FreeAgent credentials. You can see an example file in `config/free_agent.example.yml`.
