At Free Range everyone is responsible for everything, but who is responsible for delegating work so everything gets done?

CHAOS.


Notes
-----

When deploying, you'll be asked for a password. That's the SMTP password for the user to send emails. Eventually this configuration should be extracted out further.

After first deployment, you'll need to create a `config/free_agent.yml` file containing FreeAgent credentials. You can see an example file in `config/free_agent.example.yml`.
