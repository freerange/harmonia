Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to pay us some monies.  Oh yeah.

Here's what you're going to need to do:

## Before starting Payroll for April (start of new tax year)

*NOTE* You'll need to do these before following the rest of the payroll instructions.

1. Create a backup of the BPT data, storing it in Dropbox/Administration/HMRC Data/HMRC/payetools/backups.

2. Remove employees from the BPT that left in the last year.

3. Download a copy of the P9X and pop it into Dropbox.

4. Update our Tax Codes in BPT according to the instructions in the relevant P9X form.

5. Start a new Payroll for each of us in FreeAgent.  Ensure you set the date to the 25th of the month and use the Tax Codes entered into the BPT.

## Monthly payroll steps

1. Create a backup of the BPT data, storing it in Dropbox/Administration/HMRC Data/HMRC/payetools/backups.

2. Enter our pay details into the Basic Paye Tool (BPT).  *NOTE* Enter the 25th of the month for the Payment date in BPT.

3. Double check that the figures in the BPT P11 calculator match those on our payslips in FreeAgent, making any manual adjustments as necessary.  *NOTE* The P11 calculator shows months from 1 to 12, where 1 is April and 12 is March the following year; so, for example, the January payslip in FreeAgent will be represented by month 10 in the P11 calculator.

4. Pay each of us our salary by HSBC bank transfer.  Set the reference to "Salary".

5. Pay each of us our dividend by HSBC bank transfer.  Set the reference to "Dividend".

6. Pay each of us any outstanding expenses by HSBC bank transfer.  Set the reference to "Expenses".

7. Import the recent HSBC transactions into FreeAgent and explain the salary, dividend and any expense payments.  You should explain salary payments using "Money paid to user" > "Net Salary and Bonuses", and dividend payments using "Money paid to user" > "Dividend".  *NOTE* We avoid using the "Smart Payment" mechanism as we've had problems with it in the past.

8. Update the GFR history spreadsheet with the date of our dividend payment - https://docs.google.com/a/gofreerange.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aippog2awIncdHNLVnFFVHBKeXpKWUxmX1dsbXNvcmc&hl=en_GB#gid=0.

## Quarterly HMRC payments

If you're paying us for June, September, December or March then pay HMRC, or notify them of a nil-payment.  Check https://freerange.freeagent.com/tax/paye to determine whether we owe any money this quarter.

### If we have nothing to pay...

If there's nothing to pay then use the nil payment form - http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tools/payinghmrc/no-quarter-payment.htm.  You can find the Accounts Office Reference Number in the Keychain under HMRC.  Save a copy of the confirmation page in Dropbox/Administration/PAYE.

### If we have something to pay...

If there's money to pay then you can make a payment using our existing direct debit.  Visit https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/directdebits/instruction/600097312/paymentplan and select "Paye As You Earn (PAYE)".  Enter our Accounts Office Reference (find it in the Keychain under HMRC) as the Payment Reference, leave the Year end and Month blank (the help icon suggests you can do this when making a payment for the current period), enter the amount due (this is the total of Employer's NI, Employee's NI and Income Tax for all of us), the earliest payment date you can and proceed with the payment.  Save a copy of the confirmation page in Dropbox/Administration/PAYE.

## After completing Payroll for March (end of tax year)

If you're paying us for March (the final payment of the year) then submit our Employer Annual Return (P35 and P14) using the BPT.  Save a copy of the generated P11, P14, P32, P35 and P60 to Dropbox/Administration/PAYE.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
