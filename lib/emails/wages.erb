Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to pay us some monies.  Oh yeah.

Here's what you're going to need to do:

* Enter our pay details into the Basic Paye Tool (BPT).  *NOTE* Enter the 25th of the month for the Payment date in BPT.
* Double check the figures in the P11 calculator (in the BPT) match those on our payslips in FreeAgent, making any manual adjustments as necessary.  *NOTE* The P11 calculator shows months from 1 to 12, where 1 is April and 12 is March the following year; so, for example, the January payslip in FreeAgent will be represented by month 10 in the P11 calculator.
* Pay each of us our salary by HSBC bank transfer.  Set the reference to "Salary".
* Pay each of us our dividend by HSBC bank transfer.  Set the reference to "Dividend".
* Pay each of us any outstanding expenses by HSBC bank transfer.
* Import the recent HSBC transactions into FreeAgent and explain the salary, dividend and any expense payments.  You should explain salary payments using "Money paid to user" > "Net Salary and Bonuses", and dividend payments using "Money paid to user" > "Dividend".  *NOTE* We avoid using the "Smart Payment" mechanism as we've had problems with it in the past.
* Pay HMRC, or notify them of a nil-payment (check https://freerange.freeagentcentral.com/tax/paye for any money we might owe).  *NOTE* This only applies if you're paying us for June, September, December or March (as we pay HMRC quarterly).
 * If there's nothing to pay then use the nil payment form - http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tools/payinghmrc/no-quarter-payment.htm.  You can find the Accounts Office Reference Number in the Keychain under HMRC.
 * If there's money to pay then you can make a payment using our existing direct debit.  Visit https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/directdebits/instruction/600097312/paymentplan and select "Paye As You Earn (PAYE)".  Enter our Accounts Office Reference (find it in the Keychain under HMRC) as the Payment Reference, leave the Year end and Month blank (the help icon suggests you can do this when making a payment for the current period), enter the amount due (this is the total of Employer's NI, Employee's NI and Income Tax for all of us), the earliest payment date you can and proceed with the payment.
* Finally, update the GFR history spreadsheet with the date of our dividend payment - https://docs.google.com/a/gofreerange.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aippog2awIncdHNLVnFFVHBKeXpKWUxmX1dsbXNvcmc&hl=en_GB#gid=0.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
