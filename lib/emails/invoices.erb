Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

Invoices are due, and you, <%= selected_person %>, have been randomly selected to make sure they get processed this week. Lucky you!


## What you need to do

[ ] Submit Capita timesheets
[ ] Update FreeAgent balances/explanations
[ ] Chase any overdue invoice payments

### Submit Capita timesheets

* Visit the Capita portal http://www.cipherinterimresourcing.co.uk/login.aspx (Incognito windows are ideal here).
* Login using our full email addresses (Jase is jase@ and Tom's not registered) and the standard password.
* Follow the link to "Timesheet".
* Follow the link to "Fill in" the relevant week.
* Fill Monday to Friday with a 1 to indicate that we've worked the full day.
* Press "Submit" (*NOTE* Don't worry about the little yellow warning triangle after submitting - it doesn't appear to affect anything).
* Logout, close the browser and repeat for at least 4 of us (*NOTE* It's not enough just to logout - you'll see errors when trying to fill in the next person's timesheet unless you also close the browser window).
* Finally, update the GFR Schedule (https://docs.google.com/a/gofreerange.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aop7pgn0cFKFdGMzRDFuOVJFVm1ZTmUwN3V4MFF2V2c&hl=en_US#gid=0) to indicate which people you submitted timesheets for.

### Update FreeAgent balances/explanations

* Download recent transactions from HSBC as .qif.
* Upload the recent transactions to the relevant bank account in Free Agent.
* Explain all the transactions.  When in doubt about the classification/VAT, refer to previous explanations for a transaction.
* Always try to upload an attachment to the transaction.
* I prefer the description to be in the format of "Supplier/Venue - Brief description" (e.g. The Fox - Dinner with clients, or PC World - Laser printer).

### Chase any overdue invoice payments

<% if overdue_invoices.any? %>
You should also chase up the following invoices which are overdue :-

<% overdue_invoices.each_with_index do |invoice, index| %>
  * '<%= invoice.reference %>' for Â£<%= "%0.2f" % invoice.net_value %> was due on <%= invoice.due_on.to_date.to_s(:rfc822).encode("UTF-8") %> [<%= index+1 %>]"
<% end %>
<% else %>
Woohoo, it looks like we're up-to-date on the outstanding invoice front.  There no chasin' be needed just now.
<% end %>

All the best,

Chaos Administrator

<% overdue_invoices.each_with_index do |invoice, index| %>
[<%= index+1 %>] <%= invoice.url.encode("UTF-8") %>
<% end %>
