Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

Invoices are due, and you, <%= selected_person %>, have been randomly selected to make sure they get processed this week. Lucky you!


What you need to do
-------------------

[ ] submit invoices
[ ] update FreeAgent balances/explanations
[ ] chase any overdue invoice payments

It's your responsibility to make sure we get paid in a timely manner for the work we've most recently done. Normally this means preparing and sending invoices, but in general it means interfacing with whatever procurement/invoicing mechanism our clients are using, and ensuring that they have the most up-to-date information about what we are due.

As part of this you should make sure that all of the accounts are up to date and match our online banking balanced. This can include recent transactions *and* importing old statements.

<% if overdue_invoices.any? %>
You should also chase up the following invoices which are overdue :-

<% overdue_invoices.each_with_index do |invoice, index| %>
  * '<%= invoice.reference %>' for Â£<%= "%0.2f" % invoice.net_value %> was due on <%= invoice.due_on.to_date.to_s(:rfc822).encode("UTF-8") %> [<%= index+1 %>]"
<% end %>
<% end %>

All the best,

Chaos Administrator

<% overdue_invoices.each_with_index do |invoice, index| %>
[<%= index+1 %>] <%= invoice.url.encode("UTF-8") %>
<% end %>
