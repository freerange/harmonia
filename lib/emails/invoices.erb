Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

Invoices are due, and you, <%= selected_person %>, have been randomly selected to make sure they get processed this week. Lucky you!


## What you need to do

[ ] Submit Capita timesheets
[ ] Update FreeAgent balances/explanations
[ ] Chase any overdue invoice payments
[ ] Get up-to-date with supplier invoices

### Submit Capita timesheets

* Visit the Capita portal http://www.cipherinterimresourcing.co.uk/login.aspx (Incognito windows are ideal here).
* Login using our full email addresses (Jase is jase@ and Tom's not registered) and the standard password.
* Follow the link to "Timesheet".
* Follow the link to "Fill in" the relevant week.
* Fill Monday to Friday with a 1 to indicate that we've worked the full day.
* Press "Submit" (*NOTE* Don't worry about the little yellow warning triangle after submitting - it doesn't appear to affect anything).
* Logout, close the browser and repeat for at least 4 of us (*NOTE* It's not enough just to logout - you'll see errors when trying to fill in the next person's timesheet unless you also close the browser window).
* Finally, update the GFR Schedule (https://docs.google.com/a/gofreerange.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aop7pgn0cFKFdGMzRDFuOVJFVm1ZTmUwN3V4MFF2V2c&hl=en_US#gid=0) to indicate which people you submitted timesheets for.

### Update FreeAgent

* Add a new invoice for the timesheets you have just submitted. Use the Additional Text field to indicate for whom you submitted timesheets. If in doubt look at the previous GovUK invoices.
* Download recent transactions from HSBC as .qif (all 4 accounts).  *NOTE* You might also need to download the most recent statement for the Commercial Card.  This is to get the transfer from the Commercial Card to the individual Cardholder cards - these transfers only appear to show in the statements, not in the list of recent transactions.
* Upload the recent transactions to the relevant bank account in Free Agent.
* Explain all the transactions.  When in doubt about the classification/VAT, refer to previous explanations for a transaction.
* Explain each Capita payment against the relevant invoice attaching the relevant e-remittance PDF emailed from Capita.
* Always try to upload an attachment to the transaction.
* I prefer the description to be in the format of "Supplier/Venue - Brief description" (e.g. The Fox - Dinner with clients, or PC World - Laser printer).
* Be careful when explaining transfers between accounts. We should not end up with any manual transactions. I think these might be added when we have a transaction in one account for the transfer in one direction, but we don't yet have the corresponding transaction in the other account for the same transfer. It's better not to explain the transaction until we have both sides of the transfer.

### Chase any overdue invoice payments

<% if overdue_invoices.any? %>
You should also chase up the following invoices which are overdue :-

<% overdue_invoices.each_with_index do |invoice, index| %>
  * '<%= invoice.reference %>' for GBP<%= "%0.2f" % invoice.net_value %> was due on <%= invoice.due_on.to_date.to_s(:rfc822) %> [<%= index+1 %>]"
<% end %>
<% else %>
Woohoo, it looks like we're up-to-date on the outstanding invoice front.  There no chasin' be needed just now.
<% end %>

### Get up-to-date with supplier invoices

You'll need to scan any invoices received over the last week and put them in dropbox.  You'll also need to create a Bill in FreeAgent representing the invoice and, finally, pay any bills that are due within the next week.

<% overdue_bills.each_with_index do |bill, index| %>
  * '<%= bill.reference %>' for GBP<%= "%0.2f" % bill.total_value %> was due on <%= bill.due_date.to_date.to_s(:rfc822) %>"
<% end %>

All the best,

Chaos Administrator

<% overdue_invoices.each_with_index do |invoice, index| %>
[<%= index+1 %>] <%= invoice.url %>
<% end %>
