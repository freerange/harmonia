Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

Invoices are due, and you, <%= selected_person %>, have been randomly selected to make sure they get processed this week. Lucky you!

You don't need to drop everything, but try to make sure you get it done this week. We're counting on you!

You should also chase up the following invoices which are overdue :-

<%= overdue_invoices %>

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
