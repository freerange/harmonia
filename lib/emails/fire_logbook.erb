Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to record the fire alarm test in the Fire Logbook [1] today.

Please add an entry to the Fire Alarm Weekly Check sheet even if you or nobody else was present at 87 Worship St to hear the alarm.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
