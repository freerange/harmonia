Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to find a date this month when we're all free to meet after work for some good-time moonshine and nonsense-talkin'.

Once you've got a concensus, put it in the GFR calendar and let everybody know.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
