Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to submit the Annual return "<%= due_return.summary %>".

The chances are Stuart, our accountant is going to submit the actual return but we need to check the document first and make sure has everything he needs.

So be a darlin', email him and make sure he has everything he needs and all our stuff is above board.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
