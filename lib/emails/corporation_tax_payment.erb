Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to pay the Corp Tax "<%= due_return.summary %>".

Don't tear up, but transfer that money with the hope that the revenue we generate could be used to benefit the greater good.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
