Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to submit our Corporation Tax liability "<%= due_return.summary %>".

This should be submitted to HMRC by our accountants, but it is worth checking, so fire them an email to ensure they have everything they need.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
