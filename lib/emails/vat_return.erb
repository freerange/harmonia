Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to submit the VAT return "<%= due_return.summary %>".

The simplest way to do this is to file the return via FreeAgent and HMRC will take the payment automatically using our existing Direct Debit agreement. If you do it that way, there is no need to setup an explicit payment for the amount either via HMRC online or via HSBC online banking.

This is REALLY IMPORTANT. If you forget to do this on time, we WILL be fined, potentially thousands of pounds.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
