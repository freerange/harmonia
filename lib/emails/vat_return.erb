Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to submit the VAT return "<%= due_return.summary %>".

The simplest way to do this is to file the return via FreeAgent and HMRC will take the payment automatically using our existing Direct Debit agreement. If you do it that way, there is no need to setup an explicit payment for the amount either via HMRC online or via HSBC online banking.

This is REALLY IMPORTANT. If you forget to do this on time, we WILL be fined, potentially thousands of pounds.

Before filing the return online, you'll need to:

1) Make sure that all bank transactions for the given period have been explained.  We have about 6 weeks after the end of the VAT period to file the return so I'd expect all these to have been explained by the time you start this task.

2) Go through each of the items listed in Free Agent's Full Report of the VAT Return and make sure they've been assigned the correct VAT amount.  I've added some hints about what to look for in each of the sections below.

2a) VAT Charged.  This section contains all the VAT we owe based on payments *received* during the VAT period.  You should just be able to glance down this list and double check that the total VAT Payable is 20% of the Value ex VAT, although this does assume we're always charging VAT at 20% which might change if we're doing business outside of the UK.

2b) VAT Reclaimed.  This section contains all the VAT we can reclaim from the payments we've made (to VAT registered companies) during the VAT period.  You'll want to check this list carefully to ensure that we've zero rated all transactions that we can't claim VAT back on, and that we haven't accidentally zero rated any transactions that we can claim back on.  Regular transactions that we'd expect to be zero rated are those made to US companies (e.g. Linode, Github, 37 Signals and Thoughtbot) and those made to Hackney Council for the recycling and business rates.

2c) Acquisition Tax.  This section won't appear unless we've bought goods from an EC country and marked them as such by ticking "EC Goods" radio button when explaining the transaction.  If it does appear then it'll calculate the amount of tax we would've paid if we'd bought these same goods from a UK supplier.  There's some more information about this on this FA support page - http://www.freeagent.com/support/kb/bills/buy-goods-from-eu

2d) EC Goods Purchased.  I believe that this section will only appear if the "Acquisition Tax" section is also visible.  It list all the transactions that we've explained as being for EC Goods.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
