Greetings Free Range!

It's me, the CHAOS ADMINISTRATOR. I'm here to keep bid'ness ticking over.

<%= selected_person %>, you've been chosen to pay the queen some monies.  You'll probably get a knighthood.  Probably.

Anyways, here's what you're going to need to do *by the 19th of this month*:

## Check FreeAgent

Have a little look at FreeAgent (specifically, https://freerange.freeagent.com/tax/paye) to find out whether we owe HMRC any money.

### If we have nothing to pay...

If there's nothing to pay then use the nil payment form - http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/tools/payinghmrc/no-quarter-payment.htm.  You can find the Accounts Office Reference Number in the Keychain under HMRC.  Save a copy of the confirmation page in Dropbox/Administration/PAYE.

### If we have something to pay...

If there's money to pay then you can make a payment using our existing direct debit.  Visit https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/directdebits/instruction/600097312/paymentplan and select "Paye As You Earn (PAYE)".  Enter our Accounts Office Reference (find it in the Keychain under HMRC) as the Payment Reference, leave the Year end and Month blank (the help icon suggests you can do this when making a payment for the current period), enter the amount due (this is the total of Employer's NI, Employee's NI and Income Tax for all of us), the earliest payment date you can and proceed with the payment.  Save a copy of the confirmation page in Dropbox/Administration/PAYE.

All the best,

Chaos Administrator
